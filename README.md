# AI Workshop
## The goal to have base hands-on experience in AI technologies

In the scope of this workshop, we will implement POC for creating extended leads based on some abstract user profiles and abstract user favorite properties.

### Run 

Create the .env file and add your openAi API key.
```
cp .env.example .env
```
Install dependencies and run project:
```
npm install
npm run start`
```

### Goals:

- Play with AI technologies to enhance user engagement and lead generation.
- Experiment with different AI models and different prompts to find the best fit for leads to maximize conversion rates.
- As an example was used simple generic prompts which can help retrieve the first result. That result could be improved in the scope of homework after learning basic prompt techniques or analyzing openai API docs.
